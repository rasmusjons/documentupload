#### How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent about 25 hours.

#### Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

The app is divided in two major parts: back-end and a front-end. The backend part resides in the server folder. The server side is strucutred with separate routes and models.

Regarding states I chose to keep them in a store the easily set and get them between componets as well as for future possible scalability.

### What would you add to your s√ßolution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.
