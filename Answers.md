#### How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent about 25 hours.

#### Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

The app is divided in two major parts: back-end and a front-end.

The backend part resides in the server folder. The server side is structured with separate routes, models and middleware.

The fontend part resides in src folder. The frontend is structured in views and components. Furthermore, state handling is centralized in a store in order to allow for easy communication between components as well as for future possible scalability.

### What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

Regarding the task at hand, and not features on related to the assignment, it would have been nice if the app could handle doc, docx and pdf. Apparently Node cannot do this. There are som npm package that claim to be able to handle this or alternative use an external api to convert the file to txt and then the processed with the current process.

More generally, if I had more time I would learn ASP.NET. Perhaps it would have been possible, but one challenge as a junior developer is estimating how much time is required for a task. With that background and because I wanted you to see me at my best, I went with a Node/Express backend.

#### What did you think of this recruitment test?

I really enjoyed it. I have not had a reason before to work with upload. So that part was new to me and I learned som new stuff.
