#### How long time did you end up spending on this coding test?

I spent about 25 hours.

#### Explain why you chose the code structure(s) you used in your solution.

The app is divided in two major parts, back-end and a front-end, for an easier overview.

The back-end part resides in the server folder. The server side is structured with separate routes, models and middleware. This makes the project more manageable and scalable.

The font-end part resides in the src folder. The frontend is structured in views and components. I would say that this makes it easier to grasp what is going on as well as maintain it. Furthermore, state handling is centralized in a store in order to allow for easy communication between components and for future possible scalability. Lastly, routes are broken out from the main.js-file.

More generally I have tried to keep it simple and not to repeat myself.

### What would you add to your solution if you had more time? This question is especially important if you did not spend much time on the coding test - use this as an opportunity to explain what your solution is missing.

Regarding the task at hand, and not features unrelated to the assignment, it would have been nice if the app could handle doc, docx and pdf. Perhaps through a npm package or an external api.

Secondly, one could off course aim for a much higher test coverage.

Lastly and more generally, if I had more time I would learn ASP.NET and do the assignment with ASP.NET instead of Node. However, I wanted you to see me at my best, that is why I went with a Node/Express backend.

#### What did you think of this recruitment test?

I really enjoyed it. It made me solve some problems I haven't run into before and I feel like I had the opportunity to show you my current skill level as a developer.
